## What is AORD?
Aggies Offroad Racing and Development (AORD) is a Registered Student Organization (RSO) at CSU for students interested in the engineering process behind offroad vehicles. It was reintroduced to CSU in the fall of 2016 (when I first came to CSU) by a group of motorheads in engineering who wanted to design and race an offroad buggy for their senior design project. I got involved with the team and eventually went to competition with them. The next year I became the public relations officer and then the year after that I became president of the club. In my time as president for AORD I had to learn how to navigate the system for doing things like hosting events, getting sponsors, holding meetings, and much more.

## Workshops
One of the defining aspects of AORD that makes it so special is it's ability to get engineering students to participate in hands-on projects. The mechanical curriculum doesn't give students a ton of opportunity to get their wrench turning time in. Some of the most popular workshops that AORD hosts are the engine teardown workshop and the welding workshop.

For the engine teardown workshop, we dive into a Honda V6 VVT engine that was donated to us by Honda R&D. Everyone gets a chance to take apart a component of the engine, and we discuss the high level engineering aspects behind the components and their assembly.

The welding workshop gives students the opportunity to lay some beads and get comfortable with the idea of welding. We start people off with MIG and move on to TIG with students who have welded before. Welding is extremely important in the realm of Baja, since the chassis is fabricated completely in house.

## Competition
Competition is one of the most exciting parts of AORD in my opinion, as it's where you get to see everyones hard work pay off, interact with teams from all over the nation and world, and get to take a trip cross country with the team. I went with the team in 2017 to the competition in the California desert, where we camped in the sand and made last minute changes to the buggy before inspection.

From the SAE website:

"In Baja SAE®, engineering students are tasked with designing and building a single-seat, all-terrain sporting vehicle that is to be a prototype for a reliable, maintainable, ergonomic, and economic production vehicle that serves a recreational user market. The students must function as a team to design, engineer, build, test, promote, and compete with a vehicle within the limits of the rules."
