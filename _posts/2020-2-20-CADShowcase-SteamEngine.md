## The CAD Showcase Series
Welcome to the first part of my blog series called CAD Showcase, where I present some of the models I've made and discuss different aspects that make the model interesting. The first model I'll be showing off was made for the final project of my intro to engineering design class at CSU. When I first heard about the project I knew I wanted to go all out and make something that I would be proud of. It took me about 30 hours to create using PTC Creo Parametric, with even more hours spent in research and learning the techniques needed for creating the desired geometry. My project was deemed among the best models made in the history of the class, and can be found on display in the hallway of the mechanical engineering department on campus.

## The Engine
This model is based off of drawings for <a href="/assets/files/SoumardTwin.pdf">Soumardâ€™s Moteur Vapeur Bicylindre Modele</a>. It's a small tabletop design made for machine hobbyists to be able to manufacture. One of the challenges I faced in modeling it was that the drawings are in french, and many dimensions had to be inferred based on the processes used for machining. I took a couple of liberties in modifying the model to make it better suited for my taste. One of the things I changed was putting my first name initial and birth year on the plate covering the steam box. I also changed the flywheel to be sleeker looking. The reverse mechanism was omitted as well since the project already took a very long time to model without it.

## Kinks
One of the headaches in making this model was the sheer part count associated with the assembly. I had to save constantly to avoid losing my changes whenever the program would crash due to the computational burden. This was especially true whenever trying to create a high resolution render. The program also crashed whenever a material change was made, so a lot of time was wasted without gain. There were
also geometries that required offsets from angled planes, which requires a lot of setup to perform in PTC Creo.

## Retrospective
I really liked the idea of making an engine, because it incorporates so much of what makes up the field of mechanical engineering. It's neat to be able to look back at this project after taking classes like dynamics of machines, machine shop, and thermodynamics. It's important for an engineer to know when designing an engine that the piston, connecting rod, chassis, and crank make up a four-bar slider-crank linkage, that the engine converts the enthalpy of the steam into work, and that the parts should be easily manufactured at reasonable tolerances. This project really challenged me in new ways, and I learned a lot from it because of that.
