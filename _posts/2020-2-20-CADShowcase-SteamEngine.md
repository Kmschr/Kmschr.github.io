Welcome to the first part of my blog series called CAD Showcase, where I present some of the models I've made and discuss different aspects that make the model interesting. The first model I'll be showing off was made for the final project of my Engineering Design class at CSU. When I first heard about the project I knew I wanted to go all out and make something that I was proud of. It took me about 30 hours to create using PTC Creo Parametric, with more hours spent in research and learning the techniques needed for creating the geometry. It was deemed among the best models made in the history of the class, and can be found on display in the hallway of the mechanical engineering department on campus.

This model is based off of <a href="https://www.plans-for-everything.com/downloads/steam_engines/SE%20SoumardTwin.pdf">Soumardâ€™s Moteur Vapeur Bicylindre Modele</a>. One of the challenges I faced in modeling it was that the drawings are in french, and many dimensions had to be inferred based on the processes used for machining. I took a couple of liberties in modifying the model to make it better suited for my taste. One of the things I changed was putting my first name initial and birth year on the plate covering the steam inlet and outlet manifolds. I also changed the flywheel to be sleeker looking. The reverse mechanism was omitted since the project already took a very long time to model without it.

One of the headaches in making this model was the sheer part count associated with the assembly. I had to save constantly to avoid losing my changes whenever the program would crash due to the computational burden.
